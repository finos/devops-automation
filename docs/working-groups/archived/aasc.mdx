:::info
Architecture as Code has graduated to be it's own project, please visit [calm.finos.org](https://calm.finos.org) for more information.
:::

"Architecture as Code" (AasC) aims to devise and manage software architecture via a readable and version-controlled codebase, fostering a robust understanding, efficient development, and seamless maintenance of complex software architectures.

## About this Working Group
The Architecture as Code Working Group is a forum for the discussion and coordination of the [Architecture as Code](https://github.com/finos/architecture-as-code) Manifest and its associated projects. The group is open to all interested parties, and we welcome contributions from all members of the community.

## Objectives

### Maintain the Architecture as Code Manifest
This Working Group is responsible for maintaining the [Common Architecture Language Model](https://github.com/finos/architecture-as-code/tree/main/calm). The manifest is a collection of JSON schemas that defines the structure and content of a system architecture. The manifest is designed to be used as a single source of truth for the architecture of a system.

The manifest is split into a core schema, the key elements required to define a system architecture, and domains, which are supplementary schemas that provide additional context and capabilities for a specific domain of the architecture such as security, deployment, data, etc.

For more details on how the manifest is structured, please see the [CALM docs](https://finos.github.io/architecture-as-code/)

### Develop Architecture Capabilities
In addition to the manifest, the working group also oversees the development of key capabilities. A capability is the implementation of a key feature to support the architecture community such as:
* Design tools to enable easier generation of AasC specifications
* Translators between the AasC manifest and other formats
* Drift detection tools
* Automated documentation generation

As this community is still in its infancy we are focusing on a few key capabilities to help evolve the manifest specification. To see what capabilities are currently being developed, to contribute or to propose additional capabilities please visit the [Architecture as Code Repository](https://github.com/finos/architecture-as-code/).

### Advocacy
Raise awareness of the benefits and practicalities of Architecture as Code within the wider software development community. By engaging more professionals and organizations with this innovative approach to software design and architecture, we aim to advance the entire industry.

The Working Group invites those interested in helping define the future of software architecture. Software architects, developers, and DevOps professionals are all welcome to join us as we explore and define the possibilities in software design.
