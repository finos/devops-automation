title: Architecture as Code
sidebar_position: 4
---

Our collective focus lies in the progressive practice of codifying the logical design and behavior of software systems. The concept of "Architecture as Code" (AasC) aims to devise and manage software architecture via a readable and version-controlled codebase, fostering a robust understanding, efficient development, and seamless maintenance of complex software architectures.

## Objectives

### Promote Best Practices
The group aims to share and cultivate best practices for defining, managing, and evolving software architectures as code, with a focus on sustainability, scalability, and adaptability.

### Knowledge Sharing
We offer a platform for discussing the triumphs and challenges associated with the implementation and evolution of Architecture as Code. We facilitate the sharing of experiences, problems, solutions, and resources.

### Develop Standards
Collaborating to generate consistent standards and design patterns for Architecture as Code. This will enhance the readability and interoperability of the codified architectures, ensuring efficient comprehension and a common language across a range of systems and environments.

### Tool Definition
Define the required features and capabilities for tools that will support Architecture as Code. By identifying the needs of practitioners in this field, we can help guide the development of new tools and the improvement of existing ones.

### Documentation and Diagrams
We work towards identifying and endorsing tools for automated generation of documentation and architecture diagrams, like those proposed by the C4 Model. This will enable a more efficient way of understanding and communicating the structure and behavior of software systems.

### Advocacy
Raise awareness of the benefits and practicalities of Architecture as Code within the wider software development community. By engaging more professionals and organizations with this innovative approach to software design and architecture, we aim to advance the entire industry.

The Working Group invites those interested in helping define the future of software architecture. Software architects, developers, and DevOps professionals are all welcome to join us as we explore and define the possibilities in software design.

<Bio name="Matthew Bain" organisation="Morgan Stanley" image="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66839492?v=4">
    Matthew Bain leads Architecture, DevOps and Modernization for Securities Finance Technology at Morgan Stanley. He joined the firm in 2013 and has held various roles across the Institutional Securities Technology division. Matthew has been interested in computers since he was a child, starting from typing out BASIC programs from computer magazines on his brothers Acorn Electron and later deciding he knew how to fix his shorting laptop graphics card with a soldering iron, something that surprisingly worked.
    <br/><br/>
    Matthew studied Computer Science at Durham University and has worked in Technology across the Finance industry for over 20 years. Matthew is passionate about improving software development practices and driving speed, agility and resilience through a radical focus on process automation.
