## DevOps Mutualization SIG Discussions

The DevOps Mutualization SIG uses [Github Team Discussions](https://odp.finos.org/docs/project-collaboration#github-team-discussions) 
that are only visible to members of the [FINOS GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/orgs/finos/people), with optional `private` discussions available to those who are part of the [devops-mutualization-participants](https://github.com/orgs/finos/teams/devops-mutualization-participants/) team.

GitHub Team Discussions augment the use of [GitHub Issues](https://odp.finos.org/docs/project-collaboration#issues) in this repository by allowing both `private` and `public` discussions as part of the FINOS GitHub Organisation.
