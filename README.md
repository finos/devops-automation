# DevOps Automation Special Interest Group

## What is DevOps Automation?

FINOS DevOps Automation Special Interest Group aims to solve common engineering problems by providing a continuous compliance and assurance approach to DevOps that mutually benefits banks, auditors and regulators whilst accelerating DevOps adoption in engineering and FinTech IT departments.

## What are the objectives of DevOps Automation?

To unite SMEs from across FINOS members to help solve the industry's challenges as they relate to continuous automation and the related audit and regulatory compliance. Often seen as an inhibitor of productivity, we see automation of our DevOps practices provides an opportunity to drive automated compliance that help facilitate reduced delivery timelines and increased productivity. The DevOps Automation SIG has formed a number of Working Groups which focus on innovating collaborative solutions to the benefit of all our members.

## How do we work?

The DevOps Automation SIG has formed several Working Groups to focus on key themes for the financial industry. You can see details of the active working groups, how they operate and how you can get involved [here](docs/working-groups).

If you have a problem you would like the SIG to look at addressing, raise it as a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/finos-labs/devops-mutualization/issues).
